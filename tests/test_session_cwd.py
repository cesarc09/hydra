"""A session's project must be pinned to its launch dir, not the live cwd.

Claude Code carries a Bash `cd` over to later tool calls and to hook processes
as long as it stays inside the project boundary, so `$PWD` at Stop time can be a
subdirectory. Auto-register then mints that subdir as its own project, and the
memory mirror path derived from it points at a dir Claude Code never writes to.
CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR stays at the launch dir for the whole session, which is why
the hook and the CLI use it.

These tests read the shipped hook commands and drive the real CLI entry point
rather than asserting a hardcoded command string.
